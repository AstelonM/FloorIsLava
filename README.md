# FloorIsLava
FloorIsLava is minigame plugin for Bukkit/Spigot servers. It's similar to the traditional `Spleef` minigame. It features
a custom implemention that handles joining, breaking, and rewards differently.

## First Use
1. If you do not have the compiled plugin JAR file, compile this source using the Bukkit or Spigot API. Otherwise, skip this step.
2. Place the JAR file in your Bukkit/Spigot Minecraft server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Start or restart your Bukkit/Spigot server.
4. The plugin will be loaded, but you will need to set up the config. Refer to the `config.yml` in this repository or the local copy created in `plugins/FloorIsLava/config.yml`.
5. Once you have your desired settings, run `/mfloor reload` to reload the configuration file. (Proper player permissions are required if done ingame)

## Configuration
Refer to the [config.yml](https://github.com/GeeItsZee/FloorIsLava/blob/master/config.yml) in this repository or a similarly commented file in your `plugins/FloorIsLava/config.yml`. Each setting is described and can be tuned as desired.
