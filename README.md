# FloorIsLava
FloorIsLava is minigame plugin for Bukkit/Spigot servers. It's similar to the traditional `Spleef` minigame. It features
a custom implemention that handles joining, breaking, and rewards differently.

## Config

3. Start/Restart the server.
4. The config file will be created in `plugins/FloorIsLava/config.yml`. It can be edited as needed.
